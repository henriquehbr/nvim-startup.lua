# Important notice

This project is currently hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary,
trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS). I'm deeply
concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop our FOSS project.
I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

With that in mind, i'll be migrating this repository to sourcehut on **August 1st**,
after that, with the intent of keeping users and contributors informed, this repository
will be archived, and all of it's files and commit history will be removed (with
the exception of this notice), keep in mind that development will happen exclusively
at sourcehut

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

## Installation

If you're using one of these plugin managers:

- [`paq-nvim`](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim)
- [`packer.nvim`](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- [`Vundle.vim`](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- [`dein.vim`](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)
- [`minipac`](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac)

The installation method is pretty much the same for all of them, simply initialize the plugin manager and include `henriquehbr/nvim-startup.lua` on the list

Otherwise, if you're using [`pathogen`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), simply clone it on your `~/.vim/bundle` directory:

```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/henriquehbr/nvim-startup.lua
```

> `nvim-startup` is intended to be immediately executed on (n)vim startup, so if your plugin manager has some sort of `opt` funcionality that marks it as a optional plugin, avoid it!

## Usage

To get it up and running, first, `require` it on your config:

```
require 'nvim-startup'.setup()
```

Then, the last step required for the plugin to work effectively, is to create a alias on your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` like the one below:

```
alias nvim='nvim --startuptime /tmp/nvim-startuptime'
```

> By default, `nvim-startup` uses `/tmp/nvim-startuptime` as it's startup log file, but if you need to change that, you can specify a different path on the `g:nvim_startup_file` global variable

After that, you're done, just reload your nvim and hopefully you will see a message just like that:

```
nvim-startup: running on the next (n)vim instance
```

Don't worry, that means the plugin still couldn't find the startup time log file on the first run, it's completely normal and expected to happen, it will work fine on subsequent runs of vim, with the message below:

```
nvim-startup: launched in <x> ms
```

## Configuration

The example below represents all the possible settings with their respective types and default values

```lua
require 'nvim-startup'.setup {
    startup_file = '/tmp/nvim-startuptime' -- sets startup log path (string)
    message = 'Whoa! those {} are pretty fast' -- sets a custom message (string | function)
    message = function(time) -- function-based custom message
        time < 100 and 'Just {}? really good!' or 'Those {} can get faster'
    end
}
```

## Contribution guidelines

### Requirements

The following tools are needed in order to properly setup the development workflow:

- `make`
- [`luarocks`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks)
- [`rustup`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup)
- [`nodejs`](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

### Steps

If you're willing to contribute to `nvim-startup`, it's highly recommended to follow the steps below (for organization purposes)

1. Fork the repo
2. Open a new branch following one of the following naming patterns
    - `feat/<branch_name>` for features
    - `fix/<branch_name>` for bugfixes
    - `chore/<branch_name>` for small changes that doesn't fit the ones above
3. Run `make init` to setup the development environment
4. All commits must follow a similar naming pattern as the branches (which will be enforced by `commitlint`), examples below:
    - `feat: <commit_message>` for features
    - `fix: <commit_message>` for bugfixes
    - `chore: <commit_message>` for small changes that doesn't fit the ones above
5. Submit your PR! (preferably a small one and concise one, for a faster code review)

> Pull requests that stricly follow the recommendations above will have higher priority in contrast of those who don't
